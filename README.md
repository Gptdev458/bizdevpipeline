## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
- Supabase for backend storage and data operations
- ES Modules for code organization

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have access to a Supabase project
3. Start a local server: `npx serve`
4. Open the local server URL in your browser (usually http://localhost:3000)

## Project Structure

- `/css` - Stylesheet files
- `/js` - JavaScript modules
  - `app.js` - Main application entry point
  - `supabase.js` - Supabase client configuration and DB operations
  - `projects.js` - Project management functionality
  - `tasks.js` - Task management functionality
  - `ui.js` - UI rendering and event handling
- `/lib` - External libraries
- `/public` - Public assets (images, etc.)

## Database Schema

The application uses a Supabase database with the following tables:

### Projects Table
- `id` - UUID, primary key
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `user_id` - UUID, owner (optional)
- `name` - Text
- `description` - Text
- `rating` - Numeric
- `priority` - Text (high, medium, low)
- `status` - Text (potential, active, on-hold, completed, archived)
- `is_ian_collaboration` - Boolean
- `detailed_ratings_data` - JSONB

### Tasks Table
- `id` - UUID, primary key
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `project_id` - UUID, foreign key to projects.id
- `user_id` - UUID, user assigned (optional)
- `text` - Text
- `completed` - Boolean
- `parent_task_id` - UUID, self-reference for subtasks
- `order` - Integer, for task ordering

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly with the Supabase backend
2. Fix any bugs found during testing
3. Optimize performance for larger data sets
4. Implement user authentication if needed
5. Prepare for deployment
